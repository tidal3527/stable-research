# MetaMask: Web3’s Most Ubiquitous Wallet

## 1. Introduction

MetaMask is one of the most widely used wallets in the crypto ecosystem, serving as the main access point to DeFi, NFTs and Web3 applications. With over 30 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of early 2024, it plays a foundational role in shaping user interactions across Ethereum-compatible networks. Launched by ConsenSys in 2016 as a simple browser extension, MetaMask has grown into a multi-platform, feature-rich wallet that offers deep integrations, developer extensibility and institutional-grade services. The product's footprint extends across retail, developer and institutional segments—making it a critical piece of infrastructure. In this deep dive, we break down how MetaMask works, what it offers across its user base, how it integrates with other parts of the Web3 stack and where its design decisions present both strengths and tradeoffs. This is built directly from our internal research and aims to help DeFi teams and infrastructure builders understand how MetaMask is evolving and what it signals about where wallet infrastructure might go next.


## 2. Product Design and Architecture

MetaMask is a self-custodial wallet. Users generate and manage their own private keys, secured via a 12-word recovery phrase. The wallet does not store user data or keys on its servers—everything is encrypted client-side. While this offers strong sovereignty, it also means users bear full responsibility for securing their access credentials. MetaMask is now exploring alternative approaches to improve recovery and reduce risk of loss, including the use of multi-party computation (MPC) and account abstraction models that could introduce features like multi-device recovery, social recovery, or biometric-based access—especially useful for less technical users.

The product is architected around a set of modular controllers that manage different domains: accounts, permissions, assets, connections and networks. It is available as a browser extension on Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge and Opera and as a mobile app on iOS and Android. Each platform uses a consistent underlying codebase (TypeScript, React Native, Node.js) with some device-specific UI layers. Developers can extend the wallet through MetaMask Snaps, which are sandboxed, permissioned plugins that run isolated from core code using LavaMoat for dependency isolation.

MetaMask also supports hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, Keystone, NGRAVE ZERO and others. More recently, its Delegation Toolkit allows for embedded smart contract wallets and wallet abstraction use cases. Developers can use this to delegate transaction signing, batch actions, enable gasless experiences and more, bringing MetaMask closer to programmable wallet paradigms.


## 3. Chain and Token Support

MetaMask natively supports a large set of Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including:

* **Layer 1s**: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche
* **Layer 2s**: Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, zkSync, Base, Linea

Users can add other EVM chains manually through the UI and Snaps extend this further by adding non-EVM support for chains like Solana, Cosmos and Bitcoin.

The wallet integrates bridging via MetaMask Bridges, which routes through bridge aggregators (Socket, LI.FI) and individual providers (Connext, Hop, Celer, Polygon Bridge). MetaMask Bridges supports a curated list of tokens—ETH, WETH, DAI, MATIC, USDC and others—and enforces a \$50,000 per-transaction cap with a 0.875% fee. Cross-chain swaps (swap + bridge) are supported in a single flow.

Token compatibility includes:

* **ERC-20s**: USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, TUSD
* **Wrapped assets**: WETH, WBTC, wAXL
* **NFTs**: ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (viewable in mobile, manual import in browser)

Snaps also enable custom token handling, UI extensions and support for token standards from non-EVM chains. The breadth of support makes MetaMask a strong default wallet for any protocol targeting Ethereum-compatible chains.


## 4. Who It Serves

MetaMask serves a wide base of users:

**Retail users** rely on MetaMask for:

* Buying crypto with fiat via regional on-ramps
* Staking ETH (validator, pooled, liquid)
* Swapping assets across chains
* Collecting, viewing and managing NFTs
* Participating in DAOs, airdrops and dApps

**Developers** use:

* The MetaMask SDK (for web, mobile, Unity)
* Wallet API (`window.ethereum`, EIP-1193)
* MetaMask Snaps (to build plugins and add custom functionality)
* The Delegation Toolkit (to power smart contract wallets or abstract UX)

**Institutions** access:

* MetaMask Institutional (MMI) for custody and portfolio management
* Custodian integrations (Fireblocks, BitGo, Qredo, Hex Trust, etc.)
* Institutional staking marketplace (Kiln, Allnodes, Blockdaemon)
* KYT checks, compliance APIs, transaction policy enforcement

Each user group interacts with the same base wallet but via different flows, dashboards or plugins. This structure lets MetaMask scale horizontally while offering targeted UX where needed.


## 5. Geographic Reach and Regulatory Context

MetaMask’s adoption is global. It ranks highly in:

* USA (11.7% share)
* India (7.8%)
* Brazil, Nigeria, Russia (each \~4–5%)

Adoption is particularly strong in emerging markets such as Nigeria, India and Vietnam.

Fiat access is enabled via third-party providers: Transak, Ramp Network, Banxa, MoonPay, PayPal, Venmo. Supported fiat currencies span USD, EUR, INR, NGN, BRL, JPY, IDR, PHP, KES and more. Payment methods include cards, bank transfer, Apple Pay, Google Pay, ACH, Pix (Brazil), SEPA (EU), QRIS (Indonesia).

MetaMask itself does not perform KYC but its partners do for fiat on/off-ramps. It complies with sanctions via Infura, which can limit access in regions like Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria and certain parts of Ukraine. The wallet has faced App Store removals (e.g. Apple, Google, Chrome Web Store) due to policy frictions, highlighting platform dependencies and geopolitical sensitivity.


## 6. DeFi, NFTs and Gaming Ecosystem

MetaMask integrates deeply across DeFi protocols and ecosystems:

* **DeFi**: Access to Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound, MakerDAO, Lido, Rocket Pool via Portfolio dashboard
* **Staking**: Supports validator staking (32 ETH), pooled staking and liquid staking with daily rewards
* **Swaps**: Uses DEX aggregators with a 0.875% fee
* **Bridge**: Supports multi-chain token flows through its integrated UI

NFT support is extensive:

* View, mint, buy and sell NFTs on OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation, SuperRare, Nifty’s, YellowHeart
* Showcase integrations (e.g. Meural frames, TCG Fandom)
* Mobile-native NFT tab

Gaming integrations include:

* HyperPlay (game launcher)
* Unity SDK (wallet support in Unity-built games)
* Snap-based plugins for in-game wallets, identity or gas management

Snaps are increasingly used to tailor experiences for specific protocols or chains, helping MetaMask function more like a platform layer than a single wallet product.


## 7. UX and Accessibility

MetaMask has improved its UX significantly over the past two years. Core features include:

* **Smart Transactions**: Simulate tx outcomes before signing, reduce failures
* **Signature Insights Snap**: Analyzes signing prompts for scam/phishing risk
* **Gas Station**: Pay fees in stablecoins or wrapped assets instead of ETH
* **Tenderly integration**: Transaction previews show expected outcomes
* **Guided onboarding**: Includes educational prompts, recovery phrase safety, UI walkthroughs

The wallet supports multi-language UI, accessibility tools and localized Snap interfaces (`snap_getPreferences`). MetaMask Learn, an interactive education platform, also helps onboard newer users with low technical exposure. Performance optimizations include features like account resets, network switching and transaction history clearing to improve sync speeds.

## 8. Codebase and Extensibility

MetaMask is open source and actively developed. Its architecture includes:

* [**MetaMask/core**](https://github.com/MetaMask/core): shared logic across apps
* [**MetaMask/metamask-extension**](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension): browser extension client
* [**MetaMask/metamask-mobile**](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile): iOS and Android codebase
* [**MetaMask/snaps**](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps): plugin engine

Built using TypeScript, React Native, Node.js and JavaScript. Uses JSON-RPC for dApp communication and follows EIP-1193 standards. Core modules include controllers for assets, accounts and permissions.

Developers can:

* Build and publish Snaps (plugin directory growing)
* Use SDKs to embed MetaMask in apps
* Implement Delegation Toolkit to power embedded, abstracted wallet UX

MetaMask also provides dev grants via its Grants DAO (\$600K/quarter) and sponsors hackathons to grow its ecosystem.

## 9. DAO Treasury and Governance
MetaMask plays a key role in DAO operations, particularly treasury management and governance participation. Most DAOs rely on multisig wallets like Gnosis Safe, which are natively compatible with MetaMask. MetaMask Institutional (MMI) enhances this further by adding KYT checks, staking tools and reporting dashboards for on-chain and off-chain activity.

For governance, MetaMask supports direct signing for Snapshot proposals (off-chain voting) and Tally (on-chain votes). Delegated voting is also possible and identity-related Snaps can link users to decentralized IDs for verifiable participation. MetaMask’s support for Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) also enables DAO tooling to integrate wallet-based logins, improving access control and reputation systems.

As DAOs grow in sophistication, MetaMask’s ability to connect retail signers, institutional stakeholders and custom UX layers positions it well to remain central to governance infrastructure.


## 10. Security and Risk Surface

MetaMask’s security stack includes:

* **Audits**: Conducted by ConsenSys Diligence, Cure53, Least Authority
* **Bounty program**: On HackerOne, payouts up to \$120K
* **Snaps guidelines**: Least authority principle + required audits
* **LavaMoat**: Protects against supply chain attacks

Known vulnerabilities include:

* **Demonic bug**: Recovery phrase leakage via browser autofill (2022)
