# How Stablecoins Work

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins use various stabilization mechanisms to preserve their peg, ensuring they function as reliable digital assets for payments, trading and decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Pegging Mechanisms: How Stability Is Achieved

Stablecoins maintain their value through different models:

### 1. **Fiat-Backed Stablecoins**
Fiat-backed stablecoins are fully collateralized by traditional currency reserves held in banks or regulated financial institutions.

- **Examples**: USDC (issued by Circle), USDT (Tether), PYUSD (PayPal)
- **How It Works**: Each stablecoin is backed 1:1 by fiat currency reserves.
- **Strengths**: High price stability, trusted collateral.
- **Risks**: Centralized control, reliance on banking infrastructure, regulatory scrutiny.

### 2. **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins**
These stablecoins are backed by cryptocurrency reserves, often over-collateralized to absorb price volatility.

- **Examples**: DAI (MakerDAO), LUSD (Liquity)
- **How It Works**: Users deposit crypto assets into smart contracts as collateral to mint stablecoins.
- **Strengths**: Decentralized, transparent reserves, censorship-resistant.
- **Risks**: Requires excess collateral, vulnerable to market crashes.

### 3. **Algorithmic Stablecoins**
Algorithmic stablecoins use smart contracts to dynamically adjust supply and demand, rather than relying on direct collateral.

- **Examples**: UST (issued by Terra)
- **How It Works**: Smart contracts issue or burn tokens in response to price fluctuations.
- **Strengths**: Capital-efficient, fully decentralized potential.
- **Risks**: High de-pegging risk, dependent on continuous market confidence.

### 4. **Hybrid Stablecoins**
Hybrid stablecoins blend elements of the above models, combining collateral with algorithmic adjustments.

- **Examples**: FRAX (partially algorithmic)
- **Strengths**: Increased stability, optimized capital efficiency.
- **Risks**: Complexity in design, multiple points of failure.

## The Role of Arbitrage in Maintaining the Peg

Arbitrageurs play a crucial role in stabilizing stablecoins when prices deviate from their peg by exploiting price discrepancies between issuer minting platforms (primary markets) and crypto exchanges (secondary markets).

- **If a stablecoin trades above $1.00**: Traders mint new stablecoins through the issuer (primary market) at $1.00 and sell them on exchanges (secondary market) at a premium, increasing supply and driving the price back down.
- **If a stablecoin trades below $1.00**: Arbitrageurs buy discounted stablecoins on secondary exchanges and redeem them for $1.00 worth of collateral through the issuer (primary market), reducing supply and restoring the peg.
- **Example**: USDC briefly depegged to ~$0.88 during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis in 2023 but regained its peg as arbitrageurs bought discounted USDC on exchanges and redeemed it at full value through Circleâ€™s minting and redemption process.

## Conclusion

Whether backed by fiat, crypto, or algorithms, stablecoins' ability to maintain a consistent value depends on sound mechanisms and market confidence. As regulatory clarity improves and designs evolve, stablecoins are set to become even more integral to payments, trading and financial infrastructure.
