Introduction"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"MetaMask is one of the most widely used wallets in the crypto ecosystem, serving as the main access point to DeFi, NFTs and Web3 applications. With over 30 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of early 2024, it plays a foundational role in shaping user interactions across Ethereum-compatible networks. Launched by ConsenSys in 2016 as a simple browser extension, MetaMask has grown into a multi-platform, feature-rich wallet that offers deep integrations, developer extensibility and institutional-grade services. The product's footprint extends across retail, developer and institutional segments\u2014making it a critical piece of infrastructure. In this deep dive, we break down how MetaMask works, what it offers across its user base, how it integrates with other parts of the Web3 stack and where its design decisions present both strengths and tradeoffs.
